My name's **Katrina** and I'm a web developer with an affinity for dynamic pages and tidy apps. I'm a fan of ReactJS, Python, and CSS. I can also build with NodeJS, mySQL, Express, Knex, and more. :sunrise_over_mountains: Right now I'm based in Albuquerque, NM.

I'm currently working on improving my knowledge of data structures and building up my portfolio with some side projects, specifically making UI more accessible. I like to keep things creative, interesting, and fun. I'm kind of a stickler for grammar and spelling and it carries over in my love of clean, commented code. My background is in fine art :art: and foreign languages :u7981: with stints in teaching and real estate. 

:sparkles: :game_die: :gem: 
I love playing gnome warlocks in D&D and I'm currently dm'ing a very strange Icewind Dale campaign. (p.s. If you play AC:PCC, send me your card!)
