My name's **Katrina** and I'm a web developer with an affinity for dynamic pages and tidy apps. I'm a fan of ReactJS, Python, and CSS. I can also build with NodeJS, mySQL, Express, Knex, and more. :sunrise_over_mountains: Right now I'm based in Albuquerque, NM, but I love moving around.

I'm currently working on improving my knowledge of data structures and building up my portfolio with some side projects. I like to keep things creative, interesting, and fun. My background is in fine art :art: and foreign languages :u7981: with stints in teaching and real estate. 

:sparkles: :game_die: :gem: 
In D&D, I'm currently a slightly belligerent gnome *ceremoph* warlock accompanied by a porcine noble steed named Christopher Proscuitto Bacon :pig2: and ~~Bogomoth, my hummingbird familiar :bird:.~~ (Bogomoth turned out to somehow be a spy. Birds can't be trusted.)
